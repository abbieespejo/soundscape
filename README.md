# Soundscape

## About
In the era of music streaming platforms like Spotify, marketing tactics in the music industry have increasingly prioritised streaming activity to boost song popularity. Spotify stores extensive metadata about song characteristics, such as the measure of danceability. Soundscape, a React web application, aims to address the challenge of exploring available rich music ranking data by developing an interactive visualisation system using D3.js. By leveraging the song characteristics of the top 2,000 Spotify tracks spanning 1999 to 2019, Soundscape employs D3 and React JavaScript web-development tools to represent the data.
